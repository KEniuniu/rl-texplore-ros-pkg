*. Enable multiple model learning. OK.
- Defined set of models in factored model.

*. Feature Selection.
- Useful feature subset is dependent on the position of the agent, thus not deterministic.

*. Separation on transition model.
- Matthew's paper.
- Try if done. OK, re-running
  S -> S' for environmental
  S x A -> S' for self

*. Other model.
- KNN. Implementing.
- ANN and SVM.

FUTURE:

Test each model separately.
Integreate models.
