*. Enable multiple model learning. OK.
- Defined set of models in factored model.

*. Feature learning.
- ?

*. Separation on transition model.
- Matthew's paper.
- Try if done. OK, re-running on new reward model
  S -> S' for environmental
  S x A -> S' for self

*. Dynamic environment.
- Proposed: global transition model?

FUTURE:

Add ANN and SVM.
Test each model separately.
Integreate models.
